# The nine amendments

> This paper presents a three-year participant observation in which the author acted as CTO of a software startup, spanning more than 9,000 hours of direct experience. The author’s emails and diary reflections were analyzed and synthesized into a set of **nine claims** about software engineering work. These claims help shape software engineering research, practice, and education by provoking new questions about what makes software engineering difficult.

Intro:

Title: It feels like when talking about software we often focus only on the technical parts and even when we talk about process we still are obsessed with technical details (e.g. CI or Testing in Scrum/Agile). So here are the 9 amendments the
*cognitive* »Software Constitution« may need. (Hence the background image taken from the US constitution.)

Why interesting for me/tevim: This paper although you might not have guessed it by its title (»[...] Software Evolution«) is mostly focused on social factors. It's about what makes software engineering difficult and as it turns out the technical stuff is quite easy once everything else is clear :)

Outline: Author, Some Claims, Audience adding their own opinions ans stories, More Claims **?**, Wrap-Up, Schedule follow-up?

Please be sure to interrupt me at any time during the talk. This is not a »Hold your questions to the end«-kind of talk.



## Author

[Andrew J. Ko, Ph.D. @ University of Washington](http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko)

Notes:

Look at http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko. Quickly go through all the affiliations at the top:

- Associate Professor
- Program Chair, Informatics @ The Information School
- Computer Science & Engr. (adjunct) @ University of Washington
- Chief Scientist + Co-Founder @ AnswerDash

Plus, look at on-going projects, e.g. »Software Engineering Expertise«:

> What combination of technical, tactical, and social skills make software engineers effective? Through a series of interviews, surveys, and field work, we're uncovering the fundamental attributes of software engineering expertise.



## Participant Observation, but why?

Thus far discoveries are heavily biased towards *observable* activities that devs perform.

### Questions For This Paper

- What about *internal emotions* and *cognitive experiences* at work?
- What does it feel like to be an engineer day to day?
- Which parts of the job are exhilarating and which parts are dull?
- What role do social experiences with teammates and managers have on devs' work
- How do these experiences change and evolve over time?

Notes:

These types of questions are very hard to answer, esspecially the last one. Best case would be to have every dev keep a very detailed diary with these (and more) questions in mind on a day to day basis. Of course that is impossible, hence the author gave it a try using the form of a »Participant Observation«.



## Claim I

> Software engineering is structured by individual and social decision-making under uncertainty

```ruby
[
  "What's  an extensible way to structure this data",
  "How can I automate this test",
  "How do I convince my CEO that " +
    "this feature is critical",
  "How do I get my engineers to make this deadline",
  "Do these stand-up meetings have a sufficient ROI",
  "Where does this product need to be " +
    "before the end of this financial quarter",
  "Should I go home to my family and " +
    "finish my task tomorrow?!"
].join("? ")
```

Notes:
Markierungen im Text beachten.



## Claim 2

> Product design is a power struggle between diffuse sources of domain insights



## Claim 3

> Translating a value proposition into code requires both planning and persuasion



## Claim 4

> Debt is both technical and cognitive

- *technical debt* - The degree to which an software implementation fails to reflect a team's best understanding of the problem they are solving.
- *comprehensive debt* - The extent to which an engineers' mental models of the existing implementation's behavior is out of sync with its actual behavior
- *design rationale debt* - Why does this component behave like this?
- *planning debt* - Everybody has their own notebooks full of refactoring ideas



## Claim 5

> Effective developers are patient teachers, rapid learners and prosocial communicators

- *teaching* - rapidly transmit all of the knowledge to new engineers
- *teaching* - code ownership
- *learning* - self-aware enough to know when they are stuck bc. of a problem or bc. of a knowledge gap

> Because learning and teaching were so critical to engineering progress, the ability to communicate in encouraging, constructive ways was also paramount.



## Claim 6

> Quality-driven management requires trust



## Claim 8

> Coding is easy (when dependencies are known)



## Discussion Time

![it is 'bout damn time](./resources/damn-time.gif)

Notes:
- Will there be a part II to this talk/survey?
- Developmental Breakfast Revival (e.g. online with tevim)?
- Somebody else from the team with a talk? (Could be about a book, framework, past experience,...)

for concentration/discussion... nice
