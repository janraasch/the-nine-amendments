# The nine amendments

> This paper presents a three-year participant observation in which the author acted as CTO of a software startup, spanning more than 9,000 hours of direct experience. The author’s emails and diary reflections were analyzed and synthesized into a set of **nine claims** about software engineering work. These claims help shape software engineering research, practice, and education by provoking new questions about what makes software engineering difficult.

TODO: Intro. Wieso Titel. Wieso Background Bild. Wieso für mich interessant und tevim. Dann geplanter Aufbau: Autor?, Abriss und Diskussion. Gerne auch bei einzelnen Ounkten schon einbringen.



## Claim I

> Software engineering is structured by individual and social decision-making under uncertainty

```ruby
[
  "What's  an extensible way to structure this data",
  "How can I automate this test",
  "How do I convince my CEO that " +
    "this feature is critical",
  "How do I get my engineers to make this deadline",
  "Do these stand-up meetings have a sufficient ROI",
  "Where does this product need to be " +
    "before the end of this financial quarter",
  "Should I go home to my family and " +
    "finish my task tomorrow?!"
].join("? ")
```

Notes:
Markierungen im Text beachten.



## Claim 2

> Product design is a power struggle between diffuse sources of domain insights



## Claim 3

> Translating a value proposition into code requires both planning and persuasion



## Claim 4

> Debt is both technical and cognitive

- *technical debt* - The degree to which an software implementation fails to reflect a team's best understanding of the problem they are solving.
- *comprehensive debt* - The extent to which an engineers' mental models of the existing implementation's behavior is out of sync with its actual behavior
- *design rationale debt* - Why does this component behave like this?
- *planning debt* - Everybody has their own notebooks full of refactoring ideas



## Claim 5

> Effective developers are patient teachers, rapid learners and prosocial communicators

- *teaching* - rapidly transmit all of the knowledge to new engineers
- *teaching* - code ownership
- *learning* - self-aware enough to know when they are stuck bc. of a problem or bc. of a knowledge gap

> Because learning and teaching were so critical to engineering progress, the ability to communicate in encouraging, constructive ways was also paramount.



## Claim 6

> Quality-driven management requires trust



## Claim 8

> Coding is easy (when dependencies are known)



## Discussion Time

![it is 'bout damn time](./resources/damn-time.gif)

Notes:
- Will there be a part II to this talk/survey?
- Developmental Breakfast Revival (e.g. online with tevim)?
- Somebody else from the team with a talk? (Could be about a book, framework, past experience,...)



## Empty slide

Notes:
for concentration/discussion... nice
